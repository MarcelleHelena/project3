                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Strokes - among many things is one of the biggest causes of death in the world. Due to lack of
                    supervision
                    and
                    family support to rehabilitate stroke patients or patients with other life-threatening illnesses,
                    the number
                    of
                    deaths is increasing.</p>
                <p>It's because stroke is a neurological disorder that takes a long rehabilitation to overcome. For
                    those whose
                    goals are to walk again, having physiotherapists help is the way to do so.
                    Unfortunately, there has not been a tool in physiotherapy to conduct and save records measuring
                    travel and
                    mileage of the patient walking outdoors. It is needed for the physiotherapists analysis and
                    recommendation
                    to
                    fit each individual patient and its needs.</p>

                        <p>To apprehend this, we have made a device called Health-Point. It is a Global Positioning
                            System (GPS)
                            tracking
                            model with a build-in temperature, and humidity sensor to record the walking pattern of the
                            patient.
                            With
                            the
                            temperature/humidity sensor we can see if a patient works out more or less depending on the
                            temperature in
                            his/her environment. This is fundamental data for the physio-therapist to calculate and make
                            the
                            right plan
